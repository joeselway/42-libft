# libft

*Summary: This project aims to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you'll be use for all your next projects* (sic) ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·

`libft` is our first project at 42, which builds upon the basic C skills learned in the Piscine. The goal is to write and compile a library of functions that reproduce the behaviour of some standard library functions which many take for granted (next up is `ft_printf`...), along with a few custom functions for use throughout our 42 journey.

See en.subject.pdf for further details.
